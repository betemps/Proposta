abstract="The search for energy efficiency in the design of embedded systems is leading toward CPUs with higher instruction-level and data-level parallelism. Unfortunately, individual applications do not have sufficient parallelism to keep all these CPU resources busy. Since embedded systems often consist of multiple tasks, task-level parallelism can be used for the purpose. Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) proved a valuable technique to do so in high-performance systems, but it cannot be afforded in system with tight energy budgets. Moreover, it does not exploit data-level parallel hardware, and does not exploit the available information on threads.",

abstract = {The multi-disciplinary nature and increasingly complex requirements make CPS development face a great challenge in meeting various kinds of the demands. CPS integration modeling language, which is a multi-view domain specific modeling language for CPS application modeling have previously been proposed. A Code Generation Framework for CPS integration modeling (CPSiCGF) is proposed in the paper. It reads the CPS application model created during the specification stage, and produces the full configuration of the application as well as the corresponding codes to make the final application executable. Automatic code generation and fast reconfiguration can be achieved using the framework, based on the code generation tools and the CPS components library. The proposed CPSiCGF was then utilized in the design and implementation of an embedded CNC lathe system which was based on the platform of ARM2440+DSP TMS320C6713+FPGA. The experimental results have shown the feasibility, convenience and advantages of CPSiCGF in the developing of a kind of complicated cyber physical system, embedded CNC system.},

abstract = {Embedded systems are widely used in several applications nowadays. As they integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality and reliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in which the system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the rising complexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations and practicability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to test specific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity by themselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and results in erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems in the test configuration. This paper presents a generative programming approach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibility issues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore, a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practice by migrating existing libraries. The approach is evaluated for an example from the automotive domain using MATLAB/Simulink. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Modern embedded systems integrate more and more complex functionalities. At the same time, the semiconductor technology advances enable to increase the amount of hardware resources on a chip for the execution. Massively parallel embedded systems specifically deal with the optimized usage of such hardware resources to efficiently execute their functionalities. The design of these systems mainly relies on the following challenging issues: first, how to deal with the parallelism in order to increase the performance; second, how to abstract their implementation details in order to manage their complexity; third, how to refine these abstract representations in order to produce efficient implementations. This article presents the Gaspard design framework for massively parallel embedded systems as a solution to the preceding issues. Gaspard uses the repetitive Model of Computation ({\{}MoC){\}}, which offers a powerful expression of the regular parallelism available in both system functionality and architecture. Embedded systems are designed at a high abstraction level with the {\{}MARTE{\}} (Modeling and Analysis of Real-time and Embedded systems) standard profile, in which our repetitive {\{}MoC{\}} is described by the so-called Repetitive Structure Modeling ({\{}RSM){\}} package. Based on the Model-Driven Engineering ({\{}MDE){\}} paradigm, {\{}MARTE{\}} models are refined towards lower abstraction levels, which make possible the design space exploration. By combining all these capabilities, Gaspard allows the designers to automatically generate code for formal verification, simulation and hardware synthesis from high-level specifications of high-performance embedded systems. Its effectiveness is demonstrated with the design of an embedded system for a multimedia application.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have received increasing interest in industry because they have proved to be powerful optimizers. Despite the great success achieved, however, MOEAs have also encountered many challenges in real-world applications. One of the main difficulties in applying MOEAs is the large number of fitness evaluations (objective calculations) that are often needed before an acceptable solution can be found. There are, in fact, several industrial situations in which fitness evaluations are computationally expensive and the time available is very short. In these applications efficient strategies to approximate the fitness function have to be adopted, looking for a trade-off between optimization performance and efficiency. This is the case in designing a complex embedded system, where it is necessary to define an optimal architecture in relation to certain performance indexes while respecting strict time-to-market constraints. This activity, known as design space exploration (DSE), is still a great challenge for the EDA (electronic design automation) community. One of the most important bottlenecks in the overall design flow of an embedded system is due to simulation. Simulation occurs at every phase of the design flow and is used to evaluate a system which is a candidate for implementation. In this paper we focus on system level design, proposing an extensive comparison of the state-of-the-art of MOEA approaches with an approach based on fuzzy approximation to speed up the evaluation of a candidate system configuration. The comparison is performed in a real case study: optimization of the performance and power dissipation of embedded architectures based on a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) microprocessor in a mobile multimedia application domain. The results of the comparison demonstrate that the fuzzy approach outperforms in terms of both performance and efficiency the state of the art in MOEA strategies applied to DSE of a parameterized embedded system.},

abstract = {This work presents a communication-driven virtual prototyping approach integrated in an existing ESL design methodology to automatically synthesize, evaluate, and optimize a data-flow application for mixed hardware/software and even networked MPSoCs. While existing synthesis tools are suitable for individual subsystems (e.g., software tasks for CPUs, hardware accelerators), the problem of establishing the communication between different subsystems that may even be simulated at different levels of abstraction is still challenging. As a remedy, we introduce the concept of bridge components in our architecture model that, during virtual prototyping, serve as integrators between subsystems that may have different communication protocols and be simulated at different levels of abstraction (e.g., TLM, behavioral level, RTL). We propose to consider bridges throughout the complete ESL design flow: Already during Design Space Exploration (DSE), the characteristics of bridge components such as implementation cost and additional latency on the application can be taken into account. Moreover, we extend the exploration model of the DSE to include required communication-related design decisions, i.e., the mapping of binary code for software tasks and the selection of different synchronization patterns for the communication. For virtual prototyping of implementation candidates derived by the DSE, the bridge components enable to automatically disassemble the system into subsystems and hand each subsystem over to an individual synthesis tool. When integrating the subsystems together, our methodology also synthesizes the interfaces for all bridges which significantly simplifies system integration. As a proof of concept, we present (I) a distributed control application that is transformed into a virtual prototype consisting of six subsystems and (II) a data-flow application from the video processing domain transformed into a virtual prototype consisting of three subsystems. The resulting subsystems can be concurrently simulated at TLM, behavioral level, and RTL. The experiments give evidence of the proposed technique's applicability, the achieved productivity gain, and the resulting simulation performance at the considered levels of abstraction.},

abstract = {The notion of time is an important element in such systems as real-time embedded systems. Real-time systems have strict timing constraints, and their complexity is continuously increasing, making their design very challenging. This paper concerns a very high level of requirements specification used for system understanding and communication among stakeholders and as a base for development. It introduces a diagrammatic description of functional behavior of a system with nonfunctional constraints including timing plan. Specifically, this paper explores the presentation of time at this level of system description. The usability and feasibility of the proposed method are illustrated by applying it to examples.},

abstract = {This paper presents the MDE process in use at Elettronica SpA (ELT) for the development of complex embedded systems integrating software and firmware. The process is based on the adoption of SysML as the system-level modeling language and the use of Simulink for the refinement of selected subsystems. Implementations are generated automatically for both the software (C++ code) and firmware parts, and communication adapters are automatically generated from SysML using a dedicated profile and open-source tools for modeling and code generation. The process starts from a SysML system model, developed according to the platform-based design paradigm, in which a functional model of the system is paired to a model of the execution platform. Subsystems are refined as Simulink models or hand-coded in C++. An implementation for Simulink models is generated as software code or firmware on FPGA. Based on the SysML system architecture specification, our framework drives the generation of Simulink models with consistent interfaces, allows the automatic generation of the communication code among all subsystems (including the HW{\&}ndash;FW interface code). In addition, it provides for the automatic generation of connectors for system-level simulation and of test harnesses and mockups to ease the integration and verification stage. We provide early results on the time savings obtained by using these technologies in the development process. {\&}copy; 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

@article{Dragomir2015,
abstract = {In order to cope with the growing complexity of critical real-time embedded systems, systems engineering has adopted a component-based design technique driven by requirements. Yet, such an approach raises several issues since it does not explicitly prescribe how system requirements can be decomposed on components nor how components contribute to the satisfaction of requirements. The envisioned solution is to design, with respect to each requirement and for each involved component, an abstract specification, tractable at each design step, that models how the component is concerned by the satisfaction of the requirement and that can be further refined toward a correct implementation. In this paper, we consider such specifications in the form of contracts. A contract for a component consists in a pair (assumption, guarantee) where the assumption models an abstract behavior of the component's environment and the guarantee models an abstract behavior of the component given that the environment behaves according to the assumption. Therefore, contracts are a valuable asset for the correct design of systems, but also for mapping and tracing requirements to components, for tracing the evolution of requirements during design and, most importantly, for compositional verification of requirements. The aim of this paper is to introduce contract-based reasoning for the design of critical real-time systems made of reactive components modeled with UML and/or SysML. We propose an extension of UML and SysML languages with a syntax and semantics for contracts and the refinement relations that they must satisfy. The semantics of components and contracts is formalized by a variant of timed input/output automata on top of which we build a formal contract-based theory. We prove that the contract-based theory is sound and can be applied for a relatively large class of SysML system models. Finally, we show on a case study extracted from the automated transfer vehicle (http://www.esa.int/ATV) that our contract-based theory allows to verify requirement satisfaction for previously intractable models.},

@article{Ribeiro2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergActivities of specification, analysis and design of real-time systems (RTS) are highly dependent on an effective understanding of the application domain and on the thorough representation of their basic requirements. Model-based approaches using modeling languages such as UML are often applied to contribute to handle complexity of RTS development. However, UML alone does not completely represent important features associated with these systems, such as relationship with hardware elements and an effective representation of timing constraints. This article explores the combined use of UML and its profiles SysML and MARTE for modeling hardware and software requirements of RTS, with application to a case of controlling urban road traffic. The SysML profile alone does not present the representation of temporal, behavioral and performance requirements. The MARTE profile provides key resources to specify non-functional requirements for RTS, in addition to a clear description of the various relevant aspects of requirements definition of RTS, as for instance, temporal aspects and constraints. The main objective is to present the combined application of SysML with MARTE stereotypes, which enables the specification of different features of individual software requirements. Thus, in addition to the factors mentioned above, we can say that the proposed approach has an important role to specify RTS at different levels of detail and levels of abstraction.},

Our work is distinctive in two ways: a seman-tics for renement and for a representative collection of elements from the UML4SysML prole (blocks, state machines, activities, and interactions) used in combi-nation. We provide a means to analyse and rene de-sign models specied using SysML. This facilitates the discovery of problems earlier in the system develop-ment lifecycle, reducing time and costs of production. Here, we describe our semantics, which is dened us-ing a state-rich process algebra and implemented in a tool for automatic generation of formal models. We also show how the semantics can be used for renement-based analysis and development. Our case study is a leadership-election protocol, a critical component of an industrial application.

RE methods and techniques proposed by research are only slowly adopted by the industry. An important step to improve the adoption of novel RE approaches is to gain a detailed understanding of the needs, expectations, and constraints that RE approaches must satisfy. We have conducted an industrial study to gain an in-depth understanding of practitioners' needs concerning RE research and method development. The study involved qualitative interviews as well as quantitative data collection by means of questionnaires. We report on the main results of our study related to five aspects of RE approaches: the use of requirements models, the support for high system complexity, quality assurance for requirements, the transition between RE and architecture design, and the interrelation of RE and safety engineering. Based on the results of the study, we draw conclusions for future RE research.},
